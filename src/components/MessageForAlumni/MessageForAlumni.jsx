                  As we celebrate 40 years of the St. John's School, BLW,
                  Varanasi Alumni Association, I am filled with immense pride
                  and gratitude. Founded with a vision to connect and support
                  our diverse alumni family, the association has grown into a
                  vibrant community. Our journey over these decades reflects our
                  collective achievements and the enduring spirit of St. John's.
                  Together, we have built lasting friendships, supported one
                  another, and contributed to society. As we look to the future,
                  let's continue to uphold the values instilled in us and
                  strengthen the bonds that unite us.

                  It is with great pride and heartfelt emotion that I welcome you all to this milestone celebration. As President of the St. John’s Alumni Association, it is both an honor and a joy to witness the 25th anniversary of the Class of 2000. This class continues to embody the very spirit of our beloved school.
                  <br />
                  Founded to connect hearts beyond the classrooms, our association has grown into a diverse and united family, bonded by the values we all hold dear discipline, integrity, humility, and service. These values, instilled in us within the walls of St. John’s, have not only stood the test of time but have guided our lives in both seen and unseen ways.
                  Today is more than a reunion it’s a return. After decades, we walk again through the corridors where our stories began. The buildings may have changed, but the spirit of St. John’s remains timeless. This is a homecoming of the heart.
                  To my classmates from 2000, what a journey it has been from our school uniforms to our lives today. Let us take this moment to reflect, reconnect, and recommit. Let’s give back, stay engaged, and be proud torchbearers of the legacy we were gifted.
                  <br />
                  May future generations inherit a school and a living tradition of excellence, character, and unity.
